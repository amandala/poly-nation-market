              It's time for another graffiti jam hosted by Lone üòΩ I've teamed
              up with the crew at Vibe Hive Productions for tunes, and we've got
              massive support from the community once again. This time we're
              right on main street Bowness and we've got street side and alley
              walls to play with.
            </P>

                  This is a public, outdoor event so obviously no blatant use of
                  drugs or alcohol. We've got an after party planned for
                  Saturday night at the Meta Space downtown for you to let
                  loose. Just don't let too loose, it's gonne be hot af on

                  We are painting various buildings on one block Bowness Road.
                  The space has been donated to us by the busninesses, but there
                  is mixed enthusiasm from the community. We need to be very
                  intentional about creating a welcoming legal regulated exhibit
                  for the entire community to enjoy, so it doesn't get buffed
                  over right away.{" "}

                  There are plenty of opportunities to delight the business
                  owners with little shouts in your piece or themed characters.
                  Specifically we want to thank Bowness Arts, The Place
                  Restaurant, Bowness Community Association, and Carstar
                  Bowness. Come chat with me and let's figure out a way to say
                  thanks for the specific wall you're painting ü§ó
