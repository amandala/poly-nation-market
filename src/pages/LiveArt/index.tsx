            <P>
              It's time for another graffiti jam hosted by Lone üòΩ I've teamed
              up with the crew at Vibe Hive Productions for tunes, and we've got
              massive support from the community once again. This time we're
              right on main street Bowness and we've got street side and alley
              walls to play with.
            </P>

                The stage and street side wall are located at 6324 Bowness Road
                NW. That's where most of the action is. I've hidden my trailer
                in the alley. Come find me when you get here!

                    I've set up an online marketplace powered by Shopify on this
                    event website. We will also have a pop-up market on site.
                    All sales are non-commission, so if you have art or goods
                    for sale, let's get them up on the market!

                    This is a public, outdoor event so obviously no blatant use
                    of drugs or alcohol. We've got an after party planned for
                    Saturday night at the Meta Space downtown for you to let
                    loose. Just don't let too loose, it's gonne be hot af on

                    We are painting various buildings on one block Bowness Road.
                    The space has been donated to us by the busninesses, but
                    there is mixed enthusiasm from the community. We need to be
                    very intentional about creating a welcoming legal regulated
                    exhibit for the entire community to enjoy, so it doesn't get
                    buffed over right away.{" "}

                    There are plenty of opportunities to delight the business
                    owners with little shouts in your piece or themed
                    characters. Specifically we want to thank Bowness Arts, The
                    Place Restaurant, and The Bowness Community Association.
                    Come chat with me and let's figure out a way to say thanks
                    for the specific wall you're painting ü§ó

                    I've got 10 cans of paint for each artist. I cleared out
                    Beast's garage and got a mixed bag of Loop and Montana. I'll
                    hand out the paint at 10am on Saturday first come, first
                    served styles. If you're on a wall with Hebrw, Toner, or
                    Ashk, chat with them about scheme so we can try to proddy
                    the larger walls üé®
